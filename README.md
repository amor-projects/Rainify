# ☔ Rainify

A weather app focused on simplicity and clean design.

**[Live Demo](https://rainify-weather.vercel.app)**

## What is it?

Rainify shows you the weather forecast in a straightforward way. I wanted to build something that wasn't cluttered with ads or unnecessary features—just a clean interface that gives you the information you need.

## Features

- Clean, minimal interface
- Real-time weather data
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Location-based or manual city search

## Built With

- **JavaScript** - Vanilla JS, no frameworks
- **CSS** - For styling and animations
- **Weather API** - Real-time weather data
- **Vercel** - Deployment and hosting

## Running Locally
You need to create a `.env` file and add values for the following variables:

```sh
WEATHER_API_KEY # From Visual Crossing
BDC_API_KEY     # Big Data Cloud reverse geolocation API

# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/amor-projects/Rainify.git

# Install dependencies
npm install -g vercel
cd Rainify
npm install

# Start the development server
vercel dev
```

The app should open at `http://localhost:3000`
